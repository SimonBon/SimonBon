# Hey, I'm Simon!  

I'm a Ph.D. student at **TU Vienna**, passionate about the intersection of **AI and biology**, particularly in **computer vision for single-cell imaging**. I work in the [Taschner-Mandl Lab](https://github.com/taschnermandlgroup), where I explore how AI can enhance biological image analysis.  

My research focuses on leveraging **weakly- and unsupervised learning** techniques for **enhanced feature extraction, uncertainty estimation, and model interpretability**. I have experience with various imaging modalities, including **Immunofluorescence, Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (FISH), and Multiplex Imaging** techniques like **IMC, CODEX, and MIBI**.  

Beyond research, I'm fascinated by the fusion of **graphic design and science**, constantly exploring ways to **effectively communicate scientific ideas**â€”whether to the research community or the general public.
