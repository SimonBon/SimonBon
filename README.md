# Hello there! üëã I'm Simon

I am a Ph.D. student in Vienna, passionately exploring the intersection of AI and medicine in the [Taschner-Mandl Group](https://github.com/taschnermandlgroup) at [St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute](https://www.ccri.at). My work involves unraveling the intricacies of cell types and tumor imaging, where each day brings new discoveries. I'm deeply committed to leveraging AI's transformative potential in healthcare, aiming to revolutionize medical diagnostics and treatments. My academic journey, with a Master's from the University of T√ºbingen and a Bachelor‚Äôs from the University of Applied Sciences Saar, has been an exhilarating mix of developing algorithms, delving into deep learning, and more! My research currently focuses on the uncertainties in deep learning, especially vital for reliable and trustworthy AI in healthcare. Day-to-day, I blend Python, PyTorch, Docker, and Creative Cloud to create innovative tech solutions at the nexus of science and creativity. If you're intrigued by AI, medical imaging, or the latest in tech, let's connect! Drop by my social media or webpage for a chat over a virtual coffee, sharing stories and ideas. Can't wait to explore the endless possibilities of AI and medicine with you! ü§ùüöÄüß¨
